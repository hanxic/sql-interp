# CIS 5520 Final Project

We propose creating a compiler for a domain-specific language embedded in Structured Query Language (SQL) using functional goodness of the Haskell. Our project aims to achieve the following goals:

1. Build a SQL-like language that will facilitate the query process for all users, especially beginner users: Compared to R (tidyverse) and Python (pandas), SQL has a more intuitive syntax. This project plans to leverage the intuitiveness of SQL syntax in creating an easy-to-understand domain-specific language for database queries.
2. Provide a query optimization library with property-based testing checks: The project will also provide a simple library that, given the abstract syntax tree of our language, can perform certain query optimization such as filtering and avoiding selecting unnecessary columns / rows to improve simple optimization. The optimization library is expected to be tested using QuickCheck.
3. Allow local compilation and execution of queries: the project aims to complete the compilation and execution process locally. That is, instead of using online notebook or uploading scripts to database, this project aims to parse CSV files, parse and compile SQL-like scripts, perform query optimization, and return the result of queries entirely offline. While this may result in the limitation of the size of the table, this compiler will ensure the user's to be free from any database bugs or internet connection problem.
